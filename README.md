## Setup Instructions

### Running Sample App

For instructions on how to run the sample app see [these instructions](./sample/README.md).

### Importing the Library

### How to publish artifacts

To publish new versions to the **Bintray/JFrog** account, run:

```
export BINTRAY_USER=johndoe
export BINTRAY_KEY=98sdfkmykeyhere90sdckl
./gradlew :utils:clean :utils:assembleRelease :utils:bintrayUpload
./gradlew :library:clean :library:assembleRelease :library:bintrayUpload

```

To publish locally:

```
./gradlew :utils:clean :utils:assembleRelease :utils:publishToMavenLocal
./gradlew :library:clean :library:assembleRelease :library:publishToMavenLocal

```

## How to import the library

To import the library:

1. Add the following snippet to your app module `build.gradle`

```
...


allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "http://dl.bintray.com/ona/kujaku" }
    }
}

```
This adds the bintray repository to your configuration

2. Add the following snippet to your app module `build.gradle`

```
...
android {

... 

dependencies {
    ...
    // Kujaku dependencies
    implementation 'io.ona.kujaku:library:0.5.5'
    ...
}
```

## WMTS Layers

### WmtsService

This class reads the capabilities Xml stream and deserialize it into a WMTSCapabilities object.
You need to provide a Capabilities URL as argument to the constructor.

```
 WmtsCapabilitiesService wmtsService = new WmtsCapabilitiesService(getString(R.string.wmts_capabilities_url));
```

Call the requestData method to retrieve the Capabilities information and set a listener that will be called as soon as the async task returns the result.

```
wmtsService.requestData();

wmtsService.setListener(new WmtsCapabilitiesListener() {
    @Override
    public void onCapabilitiesReceived(WmtsCapabilities capabilities) {
        try {
            // kujakuMapView.addWmtsLayer(capabilities);
        }
        catch (Exception ex) {
            //throw ex;
        }
    }
});
```

### Add WMTS layers to the map

The kujakuMapView has 4 public methods to add WMTS Layers onto the map :

* This method will add the first layer of the Capabilities file with the default style and first tileMatrixSet :
```
public void addWmtsLayer(WmtsCapabilities capabilities) throws Exception
```

* This method will add the layer identified by the layerIdentifier argument of the Capabilities file with the default style and first tileMatrixSet :
```
public void addWmtsLayer(WmtsCapabilities capabilities, String layerIdentifier) throws Exception
```

* This method will add the layer identified by the layerIdentifier argument of the Capabilities file with the style identified by the styleIdentifier argument and first tileMatrixSet:
```
 public void addWmtsLayer(WmtsCapabilities capabilities, String layerIdentifier, String styleIdentifier) throws Exception
```

* This method will add the layer identified by the layerIdentifier argument of the Capabilities file with the style identified by the styleIdentifier argument and the tileMatrixSet identified by the tileMatrixSetLinkIdentifier argument:
```
public void addWmtsLayer(WmtsCapabilities capabilities, String layerIdentifier, String styleIdentifier, String tileMatrixSetLinkIdentifier) throws Exception
```
