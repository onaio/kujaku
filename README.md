A mapping and check-in library for Android using **MapBox SDK (Version 8.3.3)** 

## IMPORTANT UPDATE

**Kujaku library and utils artefacts are no longer available on bintray and any builds using these dependencies will fail. Kindly update to use `mavenCentral()` repository in your `build.gradle` and the `library` version `0.9.0` for a successful build.

## Setup Instructions

### Running Sample App

For instructions on how to run the sample app see [these instructions](./sample/README.md).

### Importing the Library

### How to publish artifacts

Due to the sunsetting of JFrog Bintray, Kujaku artefacts/release are no longer available on bintray and all publishing is done to Maven Central. Some of the packages are also published to Github packages.

## How to import the library

To import the library:

1. Add the following snippet to your app module `build.gradle`

```
...


allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

```
This adds the bintray repository to your configuration

2. Add the following snippet to your app module `build.gradle`

```
...
android {

... 

dependencies {
    ...
    // Kujaku dependencies
    implementation 'io.ona.kujaku:library:0.9.0'
    ...
}
```

## How to use the library

The library offers a view `KujakuMapView` that provides more functionality than Mapbox. 
- For Mapbox related functionality, [go here](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/overview/)
- For extra features provided by this library [go here](./SPECIFICATION.md)

## `Unable to resolve artifact: Missing` while running tests

This is encountered when Robolectric has problems downloading the jars it needs for different Android SDK levels. If you keep running into this you can download the JARs locally and point Robolectric to them by doing:

```
./download-robolectric-deps.sh
